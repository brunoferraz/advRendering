A VAO receive VBOS

    Vertex Array Objects - holds various datas related to a collection of vertices.
    Is a named object to group together certain state relating to vertex arrays.

    For instance:
        VAO {   -Position
                -Color
                -index
                -normal}

    Vertex Buffer Object - is a buffer wich is used to hold a vertex attribut array (aka vertex array).
        Its related with memory and how openGL will deal with the data alocated here.
        Here you need to know the size and how opengl will manipulate the information

    For instance:
        if a vbo is bound to GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, it means that you transfer the data to a buffer on GPU and not a pointer to client side.
